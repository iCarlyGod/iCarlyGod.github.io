Hi there.  This is my first post here, so it isn't empty when people visit this.  Honestly, I only work on this when I have downtime in my workday, so please excuse the lack of aesthetic and overall emptiness of the site for now.  I am too stupid to figure out visuals right now, and I'm more focused on getting content on the site before I try to personalize it with custom layouts and visuals.

Please do not click on the "subscribe via RSS" thing.  It's defaulted to do something, but for me, it breaks the site and I'm too lazy to overwrite the layout just to remove it.  I'll fix it once I get around to personalizing the layouts on this site.

Anyway, g'bye.
