Hi, I would say most people online know me as iCarlyGod.

I am currently studying Management Engineering (AKA: the fake engineering) at the University of Waterloo and take interest in data and software development.

My main interests are in video games.  I am a baby and an asshole, so I love beating people at party games and multiplayer games for kindergarteners.  I also like puzzle solving video games because I am a nerd.

I've dabbled in a lot of other interests like sports, arts, and (obviously) programming.  I have a good amount in experience in a lot of different sports and I know how to play pretty much every well-known sport.  I enjoy drawing and I took some classes in ceramics in high school.  Coding is only fun for the end result and when things are working.  Otherwise, it's miserable.

This site is mostly to host the blog I want to start writing about my thoughts/ideas/opinions I have on topics I think to myself on for hours and do nothing with.  I just want to do this for fun, but I also think public platforms are not ideal spaces to spew opinions.  

I might use this site to host other projects in the future if I ever get to them, but for now, enjoy the blog I guess.
